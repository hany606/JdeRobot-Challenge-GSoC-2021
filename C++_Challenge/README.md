# C++ Challenge

## How to compile and run it (These steps are mainly for linux system users)?

1. Create a new folder for build & go to that directory ```mkdir -p build && cd build```
2. Run ```cmake ..```
3. Run ```make```
4. Run ```./main``` to run the code
* In case of any unsuccessful building (errors during the build) you can remove the build directory and start all over again, or you can try to run ```make clean``` inside the build directory
* To recompile the project just run ```make``` inside the build directory
